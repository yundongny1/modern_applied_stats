# example of bootstrap sampling and estimation of standard errors

# revised May 23, 2024 by Thomas W. Miller

# estimating standard error of the median,
# providing comparisons with the standard error of the mean

# the standard error is the standard deviation
# of the sampling distribution

# comparing standard error estimates in this program
# assumes a normal population distribution using rnorm() 

# of course, one of the advantages of bootstrap
# estimation of standard errors is that it may be
# used for any population distribution

# bootstrap sampling is sampling with replacement
# which can be accomplished with the R sample() function

# larger numbers of bootstrap samples B 
# will yield better estimates of the true standard errors
# vary B by using separate executions of this program
